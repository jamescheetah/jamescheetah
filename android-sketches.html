                            <p>My Staff is a section where the owner can invite people to join the app and where they can manage people on the team. When there are 0 members, a temporary message appears, with the options to invite people either by text or e-mail.</p>

Keep in mind that this design doesn't have to look exactly this way but can re-use the existing model of how text messaging would get prompted in an Android app. The sketch is merely used to denote the functions that should appear on the screen. Additional functions that would be helpful is maybe the ability to open the address book. As the user types a phone number or name of a person in their contact list, a list of auto-suggested contacts should appear, not unlike how it works for text messaging apps.</p>
